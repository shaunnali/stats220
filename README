Edit the README.md file so that it contains some information about the purpose of the repo, so that other people who view your repo on GitHub know why you made it. Your README.md file needs to demonstrate at least the following Markdown syntax (you can do more if you want!):

use of two different levels of headers
use of two different types of bullet points (ordered or unordered)
use of bold and italics
use of links to other websites
